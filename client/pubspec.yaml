# The following defines the version and build number for your application.

# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43

# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.

# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter

# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.

# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
